# Honeypot Project with Elasticsearch Logs

## Overview
This project demonstrates the installation of a honeypot to simulate attack vectors and collect data on malicious activities. The logs generated by the honeypot were ingested into Elasticsearch for analysis.

## Objective
The objective of this project was to set up a honeypot, collect logs of attempted attacks, and analyze them to understand attacker behaviors and techniques.

## Skills Acquired
- Understanding honeypot deployment techniques.
- Proficiency in configuring Elasticsearch for log management.
- Skills in analyzing logs to identify potential threats.
- Hands-on experience with virtualized environments for cybersecurity testing.
